# bblr-hopfield-boltzmann
The goal of this project is to compare the Hopfield Neural Network model and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine model when they are used as associative memories that can store pattern data sets.

The details about this project are published in our [wiki](https://github.com/juanlao7/bblr-hopfield-boltzmann/wiki).
